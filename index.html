      <p><strong>Tracking Footfall at the Kibble Palace</strong></p>
      <blockquote>"Designing with care for heritage, people, and plants."</blockquote>

      <h2>Project Background</h2>
      <p>The Kibble Palace is a magnificent 19th-century glasshouse covering 2,137m² in Glasgow Botanic Gardens –
        publicly-owned gardens managed by Glasgow City Council. This architectural marvel, constructed from curved
        wrought iron and glass supported by cast-iron beams, initially served as an exhibition venue before
        transitioning to house plants in the 1880s. Today, it contains a remarkable collection of flora including the
        national collection of Australasian tree ferns.</p>

      <p>As one of Glasgow's most popular tourist attractions, the Kibble Palace welcomes visitors from around the world
        while serving as a beloved space for local residents. However, Glasgow City Council faces a significant
        challenge: effectively measuring visitor footfall to make informed decisions about resource allocation,
        staffing, and long-term planning.</p>

      <p>This website documents our journey in developing a heritage-sensitive, privacy-respecting footfall tracking
        solution that balances technological innovation with the preservation requirements of a Category A Listed
        building. We hope that exploring our process will provide insights into designing IoT solutions for heritage
        environments and inspire similar approaches for other historic venues facing comparable challenges.</p>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>Glasgow City Council struggles to accurately measure visitor numbers at the Kibble Palace, limiting their
        ability to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimize staffing levels based on peak visiting times</li>
        <li>Understand seasonal and weather-related visitor patterns</li>
        <li>Justify funding requests with concrete usage data</li>
        <li>Plan maintenance schedules around visitor flow</li>
        <li>Assess the impact of special events and exhibitions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The building's status as a Category A Listed structure presents unique constraints. Any technological solution
        must avoid structural modifications while being safe for the diverse plant life and resident koi fish.
        Additionally, the solution must respect visitor privacy and remain completely unobtrusive to maintain the
        serene, heritage atmosphere that visitors expect.</p>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Impact & Benefits</h2>
      <p>Our solution enables Glasgow City Council to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make data-driven staffing decisions, optimizing resource allocation</li>
        <li>Understand visitor patterns to improve the overall experience</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the Kibble Palace's popularity to secure future funding</li>
        <li>Plan maintenance and conservation work around visitor flows</li>
        <li>Measure the success of events and marketing initiatives</li>
        <li>Provide evidence for tourism impact assessments</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Beyond immediate operational benefits, this project demonstrates how heritage sites can embrace modern
        technology responsibly. Our approach respects both the physical constraints of historic buildings and the
        ethical considerations of visitor privacy, creating a model that other heritage venues can adapt and implement.
