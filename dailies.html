            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 1 - Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
              <p>On Day 1, we had a lecture conducted by Professor Alistair Morrison about how questions could be asked to gain insights 
                of the pain points users are experiencing instead of plainly questioning if the final product is good enough for the users. 
                This is important to shape the final solution to fit the needs of the users instead of what the team perceive is good for 
                the users. We even had an opportunity during lecture to ask the questions we had prepared for the clients to another group 
                to see how our questions could be improved to gather more insights from the client.</p>
              <p>
                The afternoon also marked our first meeting with the client in charge of Kibble Palace. From the refined questions that we 
                have came up with during the lecture exercise, we were able to gathre more insights about what the challenges the client is 
                facing and what the client is looking for in the final solution to collect footfall data on Kibble Palace.
