            <h3>Week 1</h3>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 1 - Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
              <p>On Day 1, we had a lecture conducted by Professor Alistair Morrison about how questions could be asked to gain insights 
                of the pain points users are experiencing instead of plainly questioning if the final product is good enough for the users. 
                This is important to shape the final solution to fit the needs of the users instead of what the team perceive is good for 
                the users. We even had an opportunity during lecture to ask the questions we had prepared for the clients to another group 
                to see how our questions could be improved to gather more insights from the client.</p>
              <p>
                The afternoon also marked our first meeting with the client in charge of Kibble Palace. From the refined questions that we 
                have came up with during the lecture exercise, we were able to gathre more insights about what the challenges the client is 
                facing and what the client is looking for in the final solution to collect footfall data on Kibble Palace.

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 2 - brainstorming</h4>
              <p>
              On the second day, we recapped the insights we gathered from the client during the initial briefing. 
              Three main priorities were identified:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Accuracy</b>: Data must distinguish between general visitors and event attendees</li>
                <li><b>Budgeting</b>: Cost of the solution must be as low as possible</li>
                <li><b>Listed Building</b>: The solution implemented should comply with the Listed Building Regulations </li>
              </ul>
              The client also mentioned solutions that have been tried in the past, such as hiring a manual counter and pinging of the mobile devices that 
              visitors carry. However, the former solution was too costly and the latter was not accurate enough. Thus, the team started to research on exisiting 
              solutions that are used to collect footfall data on other places such as museums and art galleries. Through this initial research, we concluded the day
              wiht several possible solutions:
              <ul>
                <li>Various sensors that track motion</li>
                <li>QR form</li>
                <li>Wifi Tracking</li>
                <li>Camera-based systems</li>
              </ul>
              </p>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 3 - Ideation Sketches</h4>
              <p>Created a lo-fi prototype of a dual IR sensor system. Realised placement and directionality matter more
                than expected.</p>
